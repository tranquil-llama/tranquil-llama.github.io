I'm a research software engineer / mathematical modeller / data scientist based in South London.  In the past I've worked on developing Bayesian MCMC sampling methods as well as simulations of complex biological and epidemiological systems.  Before that I was a freelance database developer and information analyst in the public sector.

I've recently been working on modelling the effects of targeted anthelmintic treatment of sheep as a way to bear down on the growing resistance to these drugs among nematode populations - you can find the paper [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751925000700).

[Here's a paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009652) I authored describing when population-level disease models that explicitly model environmental pathogen contamination can be replaced with simpler host-only models with fewer parameters.

I've also recently been doing some web development with the [Invenio](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/framework/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) frameworks while thinking about [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) metadata annotation of scientific data sets.

[Here](https://github.com/leeds-indoor-air/Touch_transfer_experiment_data_analysis) you'll find some regression modelling I did using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) to support a study of how room temperature and relative humidity affect rates of touch-transfer of contaminants onto fingers from various surface materials.  You can find the accompanying paper [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/5/1048).

Check out [some ongoing work here](https://github.com/tranquil-llama/QMRA_DEVS) using [adevs](https://web.ornl.gov/~nutarojj/adevs/) (a Discrete Event System simulator) to understand how patterns of building occupancy influence the risk of transmission of airborne pathogens in indoor public spaces.  This project is intended to combine with outputs of a flow solver, such as [CONTAM](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/contam).
